# Fraud-Detection-using-SOM

## Problem Statement

>Imagine you are a deep learning scientist working for a bank and are given a data set that contains information of customers from this bank applying for an advanced credit card. Detect the potential fraudulent customers within the applications.

## DataSet

The dataset is named Credit_Card_Applications.csv

## Solutions

I have created a list of possible fraudulent customers using the Self Organizing Map algorithm. To create a SOM, I used the MINISOM.py library which can be copied online or can be downloaded from your prompt/terminal by just typing 

`pip install MiniSom`

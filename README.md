# Fraud-Detection-using-SOM

## Problem Statement

>Imagine you are a deep learning scientist working for a bank and are given a data set that contains information of customers from this bank applying for an advanced credit card. Detect the potential fraudulent customers within the applications.

## DataSet

You can find the [documentation](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Statlog+(Australian+Credit+Approval)) of the Dataset here.

The dataset is attached as Credit_Card_Applications.csv

## Solutions

*I have created a list of possible fraudulent customers using the Self Organizing Map algorithm. 

*The Jupyter Notebook is easy to follow along.

*To create a SOM, I used the MINISOM.py library which can be copied online or can be downloaded from your prompt/terminal by just typing 

`pip install MiniSom`
